## Challenges

- Pre-election polls often diverge from actual election results
    - Time between poll and election ("lead") affects accuracy
    - Even final polls show error beyond sampling variation
- Adjusting for "industry effects"
    - Polling errors are consistent across multiple elections
    - Systematic biases affect specific parties similarly across polling houses

## Challenges

## The Model {data-name="Model"}

1. **Dynamic Linear Model**
    - Tracks party support over time
    - Accounts for house effects
    - Handles increased volatility close to elections
2. **Fundamentals Model**
    - Historical election results
    - Economic indicators
    - Incumbency effects

## Dynamic Linear Model

$$
\text{Poll Results} \sim \text{Distribution}(\text{Support} + \text{Bias})
$$

where Support follows:

$$
\text{Support}_\text{now} = \text{Support}_\text{last poll} + \text{Change}
$$

with:

- Bigger random changes allowed after government split
- Related parties tend to move together
- Allowed amount of change scales with time between polls

## Reverse Time Series

- Time series usually start with an unknown initial state

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Support}_t = \text{Support}_{t - 1} + \text{Change} \\
\text{Support}_0 \sim \text{Distribution}(\theta)
\end{gathered}
$$

- We flips this and write

$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Support}_t = \text{Support}_{t + 1} + \text{Change} \\
\text{Support}_T \sim \text{Distribution}(\theta)
\end{gathered}
$$

- But what should $\theta$ be? ü§î

## Fundamentals Model

- How would we predict election results months ahead?

## Fundamentals as Prior

- Election day support depends on:
    - Previous election results
    - Years in government
    - Economic growth
    - Inflation

- This gives us an informed prior:
$$
\begin{gathered}
\text{Support}_T \sim \text{Normal}(\text{Fundamentals}, \text{Variance})
\end{gathered}
$$

::: {.column width="50%"}
1. **The Challenge**
    - Pre-election polls show systematic biases
    - Need to account for house effects and time dynamics

2. **Our Solution**
    - Dynamic Linear Model tracks real-time support
    - Fundamentals Model provides informed priors

3. **Key Features**
    - Corrects for industry bias
    - Smooths polls and provides grounded picture
    - Fully capture uncertainty

4. **Results**
    - Demonstrated good accuracy
    - Successfully captured some biases
